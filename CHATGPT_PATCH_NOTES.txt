Applied fixes:

1) Confirmed customers helpers (buildSearchIndex, hasName, sortKey) use firstName/lastName/companyName (no contactName).
2) Verified utils.ts already contains fullName and customerDisplayName helpers.
3) Confirmed EstimateDialog and EstimateForm declare and pass productSubcategories.
4) Confirmed OrderDialog and OrderForm declare and pass productSubcategories.
5) Removed stray public/index.html (can cause 404 on Next.js App Router with App Hosting).

Next steps locally:
  npm ci
  npm run build
  npm run start
Verify routes, then:
  firebase deploy --only hosting
